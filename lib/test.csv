It was designed to reduce the danger from certain security attacks on BGP, such as TCP resets. In many situations, target systems are, by themselves, patched or otherwise unaffected by this vulnerability. In certain configurations, however, unaffected systems can be made vulnerable if the path between an attacker and the target system contains an affected and unpatched network device such as a firewall or router and that device is responsible for handling TCP connections for the target. In this case, locate and apply remediation steps for network devices along the route that are affected.

In addition, the versions of some operating systems can be accurately fingerprinted by analyzing their responses to invalid ICMP timestamp requests. ","HP-UX Execute the following command: ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0 The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). Cisco IOS Use ACLs to block ICMP types 13 and 14. For example: deny icmp any any 13 deny icmp any any 14 Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench: permit icmp any any unreachable permit icmp any any echo-reply permit icmp any any time-exceeded permit icmp any any source-quench The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). SGI Irix IRIX does not offer a way to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using ipfilterd, and/or block it at any external firewalls. The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). Linux Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example: ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition Windows NT 4 does not provide a way to block ICMP packets. Therefore, you should block them at the firewall. The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). OpenBSD Set the net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl sysctl variable to 0. sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl=0 The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). Cisco PIX A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface: icmp deny any 13 <inside> icmp deny any 14 <inside> Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

Sun Solaris Execute the following commands: /usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp 0 /usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0 The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response). Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the Networking and Dialup Connections control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets.

This meant all modules such as mod_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.
